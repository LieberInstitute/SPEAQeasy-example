  abstract = {Summary: VariantAnnotation is an R / Bioconductor package
         for the exploration and annotation of genetic variants. Capabilities
         exist for reading, writing and filtering variant call format (VCF)
         files. VariantAnnotation allows ready access to additional R /
         Bioconductor facilities for advanced statistical analysis, data
         transformation, visualization and integration with diverse genomic
         resources. Availability and implementation: This package is
         implemented in R and available for download at the Bioconductor Web
         site
         (http://bioconductor.org/packages/2.13/bioc/html/VariantAnnotation.html).
         The package contains extensive help pages for individual functions and
         a 'vignette' outlining typical work flows; it is made available under
         the open source 'Artistic-2.0' license. Version 1.9.38 was used in
         this article. Contact: valerie.obenchain@roswellpark.org},
